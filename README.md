This project aims at analyzing the trends for Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicle bought in different cities of the USA. This activity will provide insights on some important areas such as which model was most in demand, which is the most environmentally viable vehicle etc. These derivatives will help the business to deduce strategy based on current market trends.

Steps:

1. Data Cleaning: Performing data cleaning is fixing incorrect, incomplete, duplicate or otherwise erroneous data in a data set, identifying data errors and then changing, updating or removing data and correcting them.



-You can clean the dataset manually depending upon your understanding of data or use different approaches to achieve this task.
-Clean the data by removing incorrect, duplicate or missing data.
-Analyse the data and understand the nature of the trends present in the data. 
-Address any discrepancy in the data and deduce ways to either fix it or remove it.
-Make the data suitable for further analysis.
 
2. Data Explaratory Analysis: The second task is to perform an exploratory data analysis of the EV registration dataset. This task involves visualising the data, identifying patterns, trends, and relationships between variables, and using descriptive statistics to summarise the data. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the data and to validate assumptions, detect outliers and other anomalies, and uncover interesting insights.

-Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain deep insights into the dataset.
-Utilise descriptive Statistics to understand the datasetâ€™s key features and distributions.
-Identify patterns, trends and test correlation relationships between variables.
-Validate assumptions  using hypothesis testing and detect outliers and other anomalies in the data.

3. Data Visualization: The third task is to create  visualizations to present the results of the exploratory data analysis. This task involves highlighting key insights and trends in the data and using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to display the distribution of the data and identify patterns and trends. The goal is to make the results more accessible and understandable to stakeholders and to allow them to explore the data and discover insights on their own.

 Create visualizations to present the results of the EDA

-Create histograms, box plots and scatter plots to identify trends and anomalies.
-Analyze categorical features using pie charts and bar plots to understand the distribution.
-Apply chi-square tests to analyze association between categorical variables.
-Utilize inferential statistical methods such as t-tests to compare groups and analyze differences.
-Apply data transformation techniques to normalize skewed variables.
